      <h2><span>2018 in Review, in Texts</span></h2>
      <p>
        Some highlights of my year, told only through actual texts I sent
        and received.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2><span>WTF why?</span></h2>
      <p>
        I guess the easiest way to explain is just to share a litany of things I've
        been thinking about lately: how technology mediates my and other people's
        lives; the inherent knowledge and wisdom of being trans, being a person of color;
        how that wisdom is often only shared and accessed in my private conversations;
        how so much of the writing people do now is through texts, on Twitter, in emails;
        how that's often not viewed as "real" writing, but why shouldn't it be?; how people
        often cultivate a persona or presence for public social media and how that can
        differ in what I might call private social media, like text messages or emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also thinking about the limitations of looking back and reflecting on a year in
        terms of achievements or "big moments", in what ways that view is limited; about
        how those limitations shift when I instead focus on the supposedly mundane day-to-day
        communication that happens privately between me and another person ‚Äì how that
        view is limited too, but in different ways; how it's just a different slice of the
        picture, a different viewfinder that eclipses certain things while revealing others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess inherent in this is also some thinking about how the internet sees me, when
        its perspective is made up only of the things I search on Google, "like" on Facebook,
        or follow on Instagram. What does that view of a person look like? I'm remembering back
        to when I downloaded Facebook's big zip of data on me, and flipped through the advertising
        "interests" it had recorded for me. One was "Transmission, Automobiles". This was a pretty
        comically off-base interpretation of me liking the page for "Transmission", a retreat for
        trans-masculine people. What other ways are my interests misinterpreted or mistaken? Missed
        altogether? And how would that picture change if (when?) tech companies have access to
        all of these private messages? When I think of how the internet views me, I picture a strange
        hologram version of me ‚Äì¬†certain interests and traits emphasized to unrealistic
        proportion, others just holes in the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        But still, I think I feel more visible in the day-to-day life and relationships
        conveyed in these conversations than any "big achievements" list I could write.

      <h3><span>January 3</span><span>Did my best to share experiences and wisdom for gender transition</span></h3>
      <div class='convo'>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>When you started T were you 100% certain about that decision?</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>I would say I was 90% sure I wanted to start and see where it went</div>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Def not that sure I wanted all the changes or would like them</div>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>I think it was through the process that I came to feel certain</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>That makes sense.</div>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>[Redacted] is nervous to make their first appointment / about starting T and said they feel like they should be dying to start and super excited etc. And my response was like (1)you should be pretty sure it's right but also (2) how much of our feeling like we "should" be super excited and certain is based off of this narrative of certainty? Like probably most trans people we see on blogs and the internet fall into this narrative of being totally certain and 100% excited and people don't really talk about uncertainty or doubts. [Redacted] is sure they want to start T but are nervous and it seems like that's not really talked about.</div>

        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>honestly I think it‚Äôs uncommon/difficult to feel sure because you don‚Äôt KNOW what it will be like</div>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>how can you feel sure you want something you don‚Äôt know?</div>

      <h3><span>April 4</span><span>Thought and talked more about gender and being non-binary</span></h3>
      <div class='convo'>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Ugh I‚Äôm so sick of people not taking they/them seriously. [Redacted] and [redacted] apparently keep calling me ‚Äúshe‚Äù to [redacted]. What feels specific about it is that I think even in a different world where they still know I‚Äôm trans, if I used he/him, I feel like they would get it right. I.e. it feels particular to using they/them that causes them to mess up, you know what I mean?</div>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Like I think if I were a trans man and used he/him, they would be like ‚Äúokay cool, I can conceptualize this. This person is a man, and I just have to see them like any other man‚Äù but being non-binary and using they/them, they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt conceptualize this but I ‚Äòknow‚Äô they‚Äôre ‚Äòfemale‚Äô‚Äù and therefore it lands in she/her territory for them</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>Yes that makes sense. Bc ppl aren't socialized to have a conception of NB people they don't have the "image" in their head the way they have man or woman</div>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>I totally feel you</div>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>I'm sorry</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Yeah exactly. Thanks. It just feels gross to me because then I know they‚Äôre thinking only about my body, which feels so personal</div>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Like if they were going based off of presentation, they would default to he/him based on their social conditioning. But they override that with the knowledge of me being ‚Äúfemale‚Äù</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>yeah totally. I was thinking it's strange that if they're going to default to a binary pronoun I'd think it would be he. So it feels particularly violating (and malicious even?) to use she</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Exactly. It bothers me so much less when people misgender me with ‚Äúhe‚Äù not because it feels more right than ‚Äúshe‚Äù but because it means they‚Äôre reading my body in a way that feels public rather than private</div>

      <h3><span>September 20</span><span>Thought more about Asian (trans)masculinity</span></h3>
      <div class='convo'>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Also, was thinking today how the association of (e/se) asian = effeminate is a double edged sword for me. It‚Äôs a gross assumption/ white supremacy in action, but also the more confident I feel people are reading me as asian, the more comfortable I feel moving through the world in my more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù masculinity, body, mannerisms, etc. around people I perceive as hyper masculine and white. Because there is more leniency for perceived ‚Äúfailures‚Äù of white masculinity when one is read as asian</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>Oh wow that‚Äôs really insightful and interesting. Like you‚Äôre held to a different standard (a standard of softer masculinity/ fluidity) which is seen as inferior. But actually it‚Äôs a more reasonable/healthy standard.</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Right exactly. That's a great way of putting it. It's like... they still look down on me but it's expected that I am feminine in that way versus they are angered and threatened by a perceived breaking of the rule of how fellow white men are supposed to be</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-received'>
          <div class='msg received-msg'>yeah so it gives you some ‚Äúsafety‚Äù in a sort of way</div>
        </div>
        <div class='msg-group msg-group-sent'>
          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Yeah. Only to a certain degree though. I don‚Äôt feel like it allows for being very visibly / obviously femme. It‚Äôs more like the super narrow box of what‚Äôs ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù (straight cis) masculinity is slightly expanded, but still a tight box</div>

          <div class='msg sent-msg'>Yeah it was gross. I intentionally wore that shirt of mine that‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI will not be objectified, stereotyped, confined, exorcized.
